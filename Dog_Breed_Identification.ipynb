    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dog Breed Identification dataset is a collection of dog images categorized into various breeds. This notebook aims to develop a model that accurately classifies dog breeds based on image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **train.zip**: The training dataset containing images of dogs and their corresponding breed labels.\n",
    "- **test.zip**: The test dataset for which predictions need to be made.\n",
    "- **labels.csv**: A CSV file containing the breed labels for the training dataset images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore the dataset to understand the distribution of dog breeds and visualize relationships between features.\n",
