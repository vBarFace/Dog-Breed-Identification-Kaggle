## Introduction
The Dog Breed Identification dataset contains images of dogs and their respective breeds. This notebook aims to develop a model that accurately identifies the breed of a dog based on image data.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of three files:
- **train.zip**: The training dataset containing images of dogs and their corresponding breed labels.
- **test.zip**: The test dataset for which predictions need to be made.
- **labels.csv**: A CSV file containing image IDs and their corresponding breed labels.
